# Particle-SIM-v2
# Molecular Dynamics Simulation - MD_SIM-AD-2-1

## Overview
This iteration of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation builds upon **MD_SIM-AD-1-3**, introducing significant improvements in **boundary conditions, numerical integration, and visualization techniques**. The primary focus is ensuring that particles remain **confined within the simulation box** while maintaining **accurate energy conservation**.

The simulation continues to use **Lennard-Jones interactions** to model inter-particle forces but now implements **Velocity-Verlet integration** for more accurate trajectory calculations. 

Reflective boundary conditions have been introduced to ensure **particles bounce off walls instead of escaping**, improving the **physical realism** of the model. Additionally, **force calculations have been optimized** to enhance computational efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Velocity-Verlet Integration:** Replaces **explicit Euler integration** for improved numerical stability and energy conservation.
